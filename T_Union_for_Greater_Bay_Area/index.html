  <p>
    📢Note1:
    </br>
    "Lingnan Pass•Octopus" and "ShenZhenTong•Octopus" cards, when tapped at either traditional MTR gates or dedicated China T-Union gates, will directly deduct funds from the Octopus HKD wallet and will not read the China T-Union wallet.
    </br>
    "Tourist Octopus•China T-Union Card (Sold version)" and "Octopus•China T-Union Card", when tapped at either traditional MTR gates or dedicated China T-Union gates, will be treated as a standard "Octopus (Sold version)" for fare deduction. The balance will not be transferred to the China T-Union account, no cross-border transaction fees will be charged, and there is no need to update exchange rate information.
    </br>
    The "Child" and "Elder" versions of the "Tourist Octopus•China T-Union Card (Sold version)" will be charged the standard fare (without any concessions) when used in Macau and Mainland China (i.e., all regions outside of Hong Kong).
    </br>
    China T-Union cards bearing the "Octopus" logo can only be used as bus/metro cards in Mainland China and Macau and cannot be used for payment at convenience stores (e.g., 7-Eleven).
    </br>
    </br>
    📢Note2:
    </br>
    "Lingnan Pass•Macau Pass", "ShenZhenTong•Macau Pass", and "ZHTONG•Macau Pass" cards, when used in Macau, will directly deduct funds from the Macau Pass MOP wallet and will not read the China T-Union wallet.
    </br>
    "Macau Pass•China T-Union", when used in Macau, will be treated as a "Macau Pass Anonymous Card" for fare deduction and will not read the China T-Union wallet.
    </br>
    Before using the "Macau Pass•China T-Union" in Hong Kong and Mainland China (i.e., all regions outside of Macau), you must top up its "RMB wallet" in advance, or the transaction will fail. Fares will be charged at the standard rate (without any concessions). Unlike the "Octopus•China T-Union Card," this card's MOP and RMB wallets are separate and independent; their balances and transaction histories are not interchangeable.
    </br>
    China T-Union cards bearing the "Macau Pass" logo can only be used as bus/metro cards in Mainland China and Hong Kong and cannot be used for payment at convenience stores (e.g., 7-Eleven).
    </br>
    </br>
    📢Note3:
    </br>
    Please do not use the "ShenZhenTong•Octopus" card, jointly issued by ShenZhenTong and Octopus companies, to ride the Shenzhen Pingshan Sky-Shuttle Line 1, as there is a high probability of failure when entering or exiting the gates.
    </br>
    Over the course of a year, we conducted fifty tests at various Sky-Shuttle stations at different times. The success rate for gate entry was 2/50, and the success rate for gate exit was 1/50. The cause of this anomaly is unknown and remains unresolved.
    </br>
    All other China T-Union cards, apart from this one, can be used to enter and exit the gates normally. ShenZhenTong's China T-Union card users receive a 5% discount, while Lingnan Pass (Guangdong Province's all-in-one card) China T-Union cards and China T-Union cards issued in other provinces are charged the standard fare (without any concessions).
    </br>
    Attached below are the relevant logos for ShenZhenTong•Octopus and the Sky-Shuttle:
