HonokaAI 6.0 was initiated by "Rin". 

Versions 1.0–3.0 were conceptualized and tuned with the participation of "双子沒有🌷".

Versions 4.0–6.0 were tuned and developed with the participation of "窮奇" and "姜微緣".

She is a large language model (LLM).

She was researched from the ground up by our team and is a completely self-developed product. Her primarily focuses on generating content that approximates human emotional sensibilities.

Currently She is an internal project; in the future she will be used in the games we develop, appearing as in-game NPCs and as player-controllable characters (Main Character).

Here we extend our deepest gratitude to "双子沒有🌷", "窮奇", and "姜微緣".
