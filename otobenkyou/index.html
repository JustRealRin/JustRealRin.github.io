            A lost "otokonoko", a "perfect" student council president, an "angel" secretly in love with a childhood friend, and "she" who struggles to be honest with her brother.
            <br/>
            This is a story of He&She&She - their daily lives.
            <br/>
            They hurt each other while also saving one another...¬†

            Jiu Luo
            <br/>
            Me, Jiu Luo.
            <br/>
            This year, I successfully participated in the "Independent Enrollment Program" in Shenzhen and, with my outstanding interview scores, I was admitted to Kowloon Central Academy‚Äîa prestigious private collage in Hong Kong.
            <br/>
            All I wanted was to study hard, make money in the future, and give my mother and sister a good life.
            <br/>
            And yet, a guy like me‚Ä¶! During the entrance exam, a once-in-a-century beauty, who also happens to be the student council president‚Äîconfessed to me?!
            <br/>
            What do I do? What do I do! I've been bad at dealing with people since I was a kid, so how am I supposed to explain my situation to her?!!! I'm doomed!
            <br/>

            <br/>
            Hiujan Laam
            <br/>
            Hiujansis is the student council president and a very enigmatic girl.
            <br/>
            She was my first kiss... ah, no, that was an accident! An accident! Yes! Definitely an accident!
            <br/>
            She seems to be a yuri, but for some reason, she has taken an interest in me, a boy.
            <br/>
            She's known as the school's "ice queen," but after getting to know her better...
            <br/>
            Ah, I don't want to think about it anymore. Just the thought of having to be around Hiujansis for the long term is a bit overwhelming for me...
            <br/>
            However, it seems that Hiujansis is surprisingly a "high-attack, low-defense" type of person?!
            <br/>

            <br/>
            Li Luo
            <br/>
            My super, super, super, super, super cute little sister! The best little sister in the world!
            <br/>
            She's been attached to me since we were little, a good girl so cute it takes your breath away.
            <br/>
            She's very thoughtful and always knows how to comfort my heart when I'm sad.
            <br/>
            It's just a shame that she seems to have been a little cold towards me lately?!
            <br/>
            I get it, it's because she's hitting puberty~
            <br/>
            <img src="https://justrealrin.github.io/otobenkyou/Characters/Li.png"/>
            <br/>
            Jan Lam
            <br/>
            Hiujan's childhood friend. Her personality is the complete opposite of Hiujan's; she's a very enthusiastic person.
            <br/>
            Although she can be a bit two-faced (haraguroi), I think... she's a good person?!
            <br/>
            It seems like she's had a crush on Hiujan since they were kids. I'm so sorry that someone like me came along and stole her away.
            <br/>
            I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Ôºû‰∫∫ÔºúÔºõ)
            <br/>
            I'll do my best to make it up to you. Ask anything of me, I'm all yours to command. That's the only thing someone like me is good for anyway QAQ
            <br/>
            Forgive me, I'll do anything! Please, I'm begging you...
            <br/>

            Miu Kinoshita
            <br/>
            An idol from Japan, she's the captain and center of the group Kamenkai 46.
            <br/>
            I'm an anime otaku, so I don't know much about idols.
            <br/>
            I heard she's going to cosplay my favorite anime character at the next comic convention, so now I have no choice but to go see it.
