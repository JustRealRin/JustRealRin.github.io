Notes regarding publishing our games on Steam

We released three games in total. All three were unable to be listed on Steam for different reasons, and our earliest developer account (Dev:LuoJiu) was banned by Valve after it was hijacked by hackers.

2019: The Sky (Dev:LuoJiu)
Available download channels:Website, Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, BILIBILI (Mainland China), linovel.net (Mainland China)
*No longer available

2024: 7 Days Girlfriend (Dev:Rinnnnn Studio)

*END of Service

2025: OTOBENKYOU (Dev:Rinnnnn Studio)

We are considering alternative options and are actively researching strategies to publish the games on DLsite, itch.io, Microsoft Store, Google Play Store, and the Apple App Store.
