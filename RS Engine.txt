RS Engine is a rapid development and deployment engine centered on HTML5, suitable for creating Progressive Web Apps, websites, and games.

It is compatible with projects developed using Adobe Animate, GameCreator, IntelliJ IDEA, and Android Studio.

The engine enables quick resource swapping and UI/UX management for projects built with or containing HTML5, XML, CSS, JavaScript (including JSON), and TypeScript.

To accommodate the legacy technology requirements of certain clients during outsourced projects (such as Windows 7 32-bit with Internet Explorer and the ActiveX Flash Player), RS Engine supports the editing of ActionScript (.as) files. However, we plan to phase out this technology in the future.

Please note that the engine is currently for internal use only and is not available to the public. Thank you for your understanding.
